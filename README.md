Real-Time Detection of Abnormal Energy Consumption using Isolation Forest Anomaly Detection

A real-time anomaly detection interface built with Python, Pandas, and Isolation Forest to enhance energy usage awareness and efficiency. The system processes live or batch energy consumption data (e.g., from smart meters or sensors), detects unusual patterns, and automatically flags abnormal consumption events.

By leveraging unsupervised learning (Isolation Forest), the model learns what "normal" energy behavior looks like and continuously compares incoming data to it. When a pattern significantly deviates (e.g., a sudden spike from a failing device or an energy leak), the system identifies it as an anomaly and can trigger alerts
